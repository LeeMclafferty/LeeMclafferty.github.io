    <div class="mb-5 m-lg-2 text-light rounded-bottom-3 card-color card">
      <p class="reading mx-auto my-5"> Think Ahead is an engaging 3D puzzle game project that I was able to see through to completion. This project showcases my programming expertise, featuring clean code and well-abstracted functionality. Designed to test and enhance players' spatial reasoning skills, Think Ahead challenges players to strategically plan their moves in advance. The objective of the game is to guide a pig to its mud puddle by carefully visualizing each move before executing them all simultaneously. As a testament to my continued growth and development as a programmer, Think Ahead demonstrates my ability to create an immersive and thought-provoking gaming experience.</p>

    <div class="mb-5 m-lg-2 text-light rounded-bottom-3 card-color card">
      <p class="reading mx-auto my-5">ThinkAhead holds a special place in my programming journey as it marks a significant shift in my approach to game development. For this project, I embraced a more structured and methodical process, planning the entire game loop, scope, time frame, and art direction before diving into the actual development. While ThinkAhead is a smaller-scale game, this comprehensive planning proved invaluable, allowing me to make well-informed, iterative changes based on player feedback and personal gameplay experiences. To provide insight into my planning process and demonstrate my growth as a game developer, I have documented every stage of the project in a series of Milanote boards. This experience has not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of strategic planning and adaptability in crafting a captivating and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>

      <p class="reading mx-auto my-5">During the development of this game, I placed a strong emphasis on scalability, ensuring that the codebase was designed with future growth and adaptability in mind. One key strategy I employed to achieve this was the implementation of a procedurally generated grid system for the playing field. By defining the vertices of the planes and generating them programmatically, I was able to swiftly test various board sizes to identify the optimal dimensions for gameplay. Furthermore, this approach grants me the flexibility to experiment with different sizes and shapes in the future, should I choose to expand the game's content.

      <p class="reading mx-auto my-5">At the top of this page, you'll find a video where I talk more about my thought process during development.  Throughout this development cycle, I have learned several valuable lessons, including designing code that is easy to read, abstracting functionality where appropriate, and leveraging the call stack for effective debugging. Interestingly, most of the bugs encountered during the playtests were not present in the editor but only appeared in the packaged game. This experience has not only contributed to my growth as a developer but has also helped me refine my problem-solving skills. I highly recommend taking a look at the code to gain insights into my thought process and development approach.</p>
